## Description
The HTML file defines a simple webpage with a div element having the id "divinfo."
The script tag includes an external JavaScript file (Dom1.js) responsible for styling the div.

The JavaScript file (Dom1.js) is responsible for styling the div with the id "divinfo."
It selects the div element using getElementById.
Various styles are applied to the div, including background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, width, and text color.
Together, these files create a webpage with a styled div element. The styles applied to the div are defined in the JavaScript file, and the result is a yellow div with blue text, specific margins, padding, font size, and dimensions.
